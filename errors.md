# Code 0 (openai.error.ServiceUnavailibleError)
The server could not be contacted because it is unavailible. 
This may be for maintenance, or because the server is overloaded.
Try again later when the server's load is lower.

# Code 1 (openai.error.RateLimitError)
The server recieved too many requests in short time from the client.
You have exceeded the rate limit. 
This can be triggered if you run the program several times.
This error can also be triggered if the server is overloaded.
Wait 2-5 minutes before running the program again.

# Code 2 (openai.error.Timeout)
The server took too long to respond. 
Either the request wasn't recieved, or there was a server error. 
Try running the program again. 

# Code 3 (openai.error.AuthenticationError)
The server could not authenticate the supplied API key.
This could be because the key was invalid, incorrect, or was changed in transport.
Ensure your API key is valid, and try again.

# Code 4 (Unknown error)
An unknown error occured while trying to contact the server.
The server may be unavailible, or there may be another issue.
Try waiting 5-10 minutes, then running the program again.

*If none of these solutions work, please contact me and I will supply instructions to fix errors.
All of these errors are server-side, meaning I cannot fix them.*
**The code is not broken, the server is.**
